This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: neglecting to install necessary dependencies for running tests. The initial `Dockerfile` attempts to execute unit tests using `unittest`, but fails because the testing libraries are not installed. The `Dockerfile.fixed` shows the corrected version, which includes the `unittest` framework installation using pip.
